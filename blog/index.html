            Yea, what should I write about? This is just filler text anyway,
            let's see, how did that vim plugin for generating lorem ipsum
            like text go again? Anyway, I have little aspirations as a
            writer, but I do sometimes get the nagging feeling that I want
            to write about the things I come across while working on
            projects or getting myself into a new language or way of
            programming. Like when I got really into Scala and all but fell
            in love with its handy combination of functional,
            object-oriented and procedural programming. I guess you could
            say it catered to my lazyness because it allowed me an easy way
            out when I couldn't think (recurse) my way to a purely
            functional (tm?) solution, but I loved it. With the wisdom of a
            few months between that experience and now, I also have come to
            believe that some problems are better expressed in one style
            than another. For that sake allowing combinations seem like a
            great thing. No doubt that anything can be written in any
            Turing-complete language, but too much quote-blood has been
            spilt over poorly emulating Lisp in C so I won't repeat that
            here.

            Paragraphs are the crux of the matter.
