Hi, I'm Nicolas and I'm a software engineer. I was born in
Beveren-Waas, [Belgium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium) but
have since been to many places in the world. I studied primarily
at the [Katholieke Universiteit Leuven](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katholieke_Universiteit_Leuven),
but thanks to the [erasmus programme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasmus_Programme) I was able
to study for a year at the [Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_University_of_Barcelona)
in Spain.

If you want to get in touch, the best way to contact me is by sending
mail to **nicolas [[at]] hillegeer [[dot]] com**, replace the words with
the symbols they represent and you're good to go.

Professionally, I tend to do freelancing but have also worked full-time as an employee.
I've performed a variety of interesting roles and you can read more about it in my
[résumé](/cv-alt/cv.pdf). In case of doubt, don't hesitate to shoot me a mail to see
if I'm free or want to work with you on the next big thing.

In my spare time I also enjoy hacking on side-projects, such as my [3D engine](https://github.com/warfare/prototype) or
my [optimization algorithms](https://github.com/Aktau/Scalaga) experiments (with [ants](https://github.com/Aktau/Scalants)!).
(or some really tiny things, like a little executable that [hides your mouse pointer on linux](https://github.com/Aktau/hhpc) when you haven't moved it
in a while).

I like to play soccer, run, ski, program, travel,
learn languages, get to know new people and too many
other things to sum up.
