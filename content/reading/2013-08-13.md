- [searching a sorted matrix faster](http://twistedoakstudios.com/blog/Post5365_searching-a-sorted-matrix-faster)

    Features an interesting (but ugly) optimal algorithm and a good case of "most people get this wrong"&trade;. I tried searching for a solution before looking at the answers, and unfortunately guessed the multi-binary search one. I absolutely loved the simplicity and elegance of the linear solution though, I smacked myself in the head that I didn't think of it. After reading about the linear algorithm, I thought a combination of multi-binary search and the linear algorithm would do... and I was wrong again. Embarrased for the second time, I just read on for the optimal solution and enjoyed the article.
