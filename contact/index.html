<h1 id="about-me">About me</h1>

<p><img src="/images/bahia-lencois-small.jpg" alt="A picture of me taken in Lençóis, Bahia, Brasil" /></p>

<p>Hi, I’m Nicolas and I’m a software engineer. I was born in
Beveren-Waas, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium">Belgium</a> but
have since been to many places in the world. I studied primarily
at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katholieke_Universiteit_Leuven">Katholieke Universiteit Leuven</a>,
but thanks to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasmus_Programme">erasmus programme</a> I was able
to study for a year at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_University_of_Barcelona">Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona</a>
in Spain.</p>

<h2 id="work">Work</h2>

<p>Professionally, I tend to do <strong>freelancing</strong> but have also worked <strong>full-time as an employee</strong>.
I’ve performed a variety of interesting roles, you can read more about it in my
<a href="/cv-alt/cv.pdf">résumé</a>. In short, I do <strong>full-stack web development, server software,
desktop software, database operations, deployment</strong>, anything except for embedded
development really (though I would like to get into that as well at some point).</p>

<p>I believe that in the world of software, having a perspective from many
subdisciplines is a good thing. Having ever done one thing has
its specialization advantages but also suffers from diminishing returns.
While exploring different subdisciplines in this field in my experience has
a positive feedback effect on the other subdisciplines. In other
words, the adage “jack of all trades, master of none” is even less applicable
in the software business than in others. Learning isn’t a zero-sum game.
(of course you shouldn’t take this to extremes, learning how to declare
a variable in one language won’t make you a better programmer in another nor
teach you how to manage a project).</p>

<p>In case of doubt, don’t hesitate to shoot me a mail to see
if I’m free or could work with you on the next big thing.</p>

<h2 id="leisure">Leisure</h2>

<p>In my spare time I enjoy hacking on side-projects, such as a tiny <a href="https://github.com/warfare/prototype">3D engine</a> or
some <a href="https://github.com/Aktau/Scalaga">optimization algorithm</a> experiments (with <a href="https://github.com/Aktau/Scalants">ants</a>!).
(or some really tiny things, like a little executable that <a href="https://github.com/Aktau/hhpc">hides your mouse pointer on linux</a> when you haven’t moved it
in a while).</p>

<p>I like to play soccer, run, ski, program, travel, listening to music
, learn languages, get to know new people and too many
other things to sum up.</p>

<p>As for reading, I usually read fiction since I find that it calms my mind
and I end up feeling refreshed after finishing a good fiction book.
The vast space of books makes it hard for me to choose, so I tend to go
for the classics because they’ve been vetted by a lot of people.
The last few fiction books I read were:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Lord of the Flies</strong>, <em>by William Golding</em></li>
  <li><strong>Ender’s Game</strong>, <em>by Orson Scott Card</em></li>
  <li><strong>Journey to the Centre of the Earth</strong>, <em>by Jules Verne</em></li>
  <li><strong>The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy</strong>, <em>by Douglas Adams</em></li>
  <li><strong>A few short stories</strong>, <em>by Isaac Asimov</em> (who never ceases to amaze me)</li>
</ul>

<p>That said I enjoy books related to development as well, some that
I plan to read or am reading right now:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Graphics Programming Black Book</strong>, <em>by Michael Abrash</em></li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/sarabander/sicp-pdf">SICP</a>, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</strong>, <em>by Abelson, Sussman, and Sussman</em></li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/HtDP2e/">HTDP</a>, How to Design Programs</strong>, <em>by Felleisen, Findler, Flatt and Krishnamurthi</em></li>
</ul>
