        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <article>
            <p>Welcome to my brand new page, this will hopefully be the least interesting of all the things I write here. So what will I write about?</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>programming</strong>: when I’ve got something to say about the open-source software I write, or want to illustrate a technique I utilised while writing closed-source software.</li>
</ul><p>The blog is hosted (for now) on <a href="https://github.com/">github</a>, and statically generated with <a href="http://nanoc.ws/">nanoc</a>. At first I thought that – not exactly being a rubyist – it would be quite hard to get started, but I managed to set it all up in a day. It’s not that difficult after all. The most difficult thing was probably to get <a href="http://pygments.org/">pygments</a> to work for code highlighting and choosing an apprioprate style, I chose to emulate github.</p>

<p>There are plenty of tutorials on how to get started, but here’s a nudge if you’re on OSX:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash"><span class="c"># get the latest and greatest ruby</span>
<span class="nv">$ </span>brew install ruby

<span class="c"># make sure the local ruby and gem paths are added to $PAH, make sure</span>
<span class="c"># `which gem` gives the local gem executable</span>
<span class="c"># instead of the system default</span>
<span class="nv">$ </span>edit ~/.zshrc <span class="c"># or ~/.bashrc ...</span>

<span class="nv">$ </span>gem install bundler

<span class="c"># clone this repo or your own or start from scratch</span>
<span class="c"># the repo has a gemfile with most of the things you</span>
<span class="c"># need to get started</span>
<span class="nv">$ </span>git clone ...

<span class="c"># if you want code highlighting, install pygments</span>
<span class="c"># (alternatively you can use the built-in CodeRay)</span>
<span class="nv">$ </span>sudo easy_install Pygments

<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cd </span>aktau.github.com

<span class="c"># make sure bundler exports its executables to /usr/local/bin</span>
<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">BUNDLE_BIN</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"/usr/local/bin"</span>
<span class="nv">$ </span>bundle install

<span class="c"># compile with nanoc</span>
<span class="nv">$ </span>nanoc <span class="c"># (or bundle exec nanoc, if you want to be specific about versions)</span>

<span class="c"># if you want to have guard watch your folders and automatically</span>
<span class="c"># recompile while you're editing, which is really handy, just</span>
<span class="c"># do this once:</span>
<span class="nv">$ </span>bundle <span class="nb">exec </span>guard init nanoc

<span class="c">#start watching:</span>
<span class="nv">$ </span>bundle <span class="nb">exec </span>guard

<span class="c"># run nanoc's internal webserver to preview what you just did</span>
<span class="nv">$ </span>nanoc view</code></pre>
